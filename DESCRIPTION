Description: Provides functions to create contour-enhanced forest plots for meta-analysis, 
    supporting binary outcomes (e.g., odds ratios, risk ratios), continuous outcomes (e.g., correlations), 
    and prevalence estimates. Includes options for prediction intervals, customized colors, study labeling, 
    and contour shading to highlight regions of statistical significance. Based on 'metafor' and 'ggplot2'.
